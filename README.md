# Acountref-v-1.1

Added functionalities to version 1.0:

- Now project can be saved at any progress (when you finish placing positions, when you have assigned files or when you have obtained results).
- Subjective integration windows added: 10, 100 and 350 ms. (This calculation takes time so you will have to wait significantly more to obtain results).
- XLS export bugs fixed.
- Windowing method changed in energy ratio calculations (the signal is windowed before filtering)
